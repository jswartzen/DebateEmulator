# DebateEmulator
This is just for my own personal curiousity. I wondered what some of the best ways were to organize a round-robin style debate tournament that is followed by elimination rounds, typically starting with the top 32 teams (double-octos).

Most emulation was done by just hard-coding different functions and looking at the results. There is a bit of support for matches where the outcome is random, but based on a normalized ability score given to each team. The objective would be that the teams with the best ability would make it to the elimination rounds and go the furthest.

Another point of all this is to play with the git and github integration with Visual Studio 2015.
